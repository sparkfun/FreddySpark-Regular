# Freddy Spark Typeface
A modification of the "Fredoka One" typeface, originally created by [Milena Brand√£o](mailto:milenabbrandao@gmail.com), later extended by Ben Nathan, and maintained by [The Fredoka Project Authors](https://github.com/hafontia-zz/Fredoka-One)

This typeface makes changes to a few of the original glyphs in order to optimize it for SparkFun Electronics' small slikscreen labels.
